  "name": "Shapes to train past material",
  "description": "This experiment was designed to revise outdated study material and introduce new material. The concept was to make two different kinds of forms, each with their own special variables, and to prompt the background to change colour when an ellipse collides with a canvas frame.",
  "background": "The work relates back to the complexity lecture,more specifically the one that introduces velocity, acceleration, and stimulates to use classes for two different figures to set distinctive constants.",
